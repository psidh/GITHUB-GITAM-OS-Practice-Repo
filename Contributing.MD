# Contributing Guide

Welcome!
We‚Äôre so happy you‚Äôre interested in contributing to this project.
This guide will help you understand **how to contribute**, step by step.

---

## What does ‚Äúcontributing‚Äù mean?

Contributing means helping to make the project better.
It can be:

* Fixing a bug
* Adding a new feature
* Improving documentation
* Suggesting ideas

---

## Before you start

1.  **Fall in love with the project:** See how it can help you in your daily life.
2.  **Find an issue:** While using the project, did you notice something that could be done better? That's an issue!
3.  **Check the issue tracker:** If you're looking for a place to start, check out the existing issues.
4.  **Fork the repo** ‚Üí This makes a personal copy of the project in your GitHub account.
    *(Think of it like making your own notebook where you can write without changing the original one.)*
5.  **Clone the repo** ‚Üí Download your copy to your computer.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GITHUB-GITAM-OS-Practice-Repo.git
    ```
6.  **Install dependencies** ‚Üí Some projects need extra software to run.
    Usually, you‚Äôll run:
    ```bash
    npm install   # if JavaScript/Node.js
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # if Python
    ```
    HERE NOT NEED MOSTLY

    (Check the README for details.)

## Create a new branch

Branches let you work on changes without touching the main project directly.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
```

* `my-feature` can be any name (like `fix-typo` or `add-login-button`).

---

## Make your changes

* Edit files, write code, or improve docs.
* Keep your changes **small and focused** (easier to review).

---

## Test your changes

* Run the project and check if everything still works.
* If there are tests, run them:

  ```bash
  // some test command if given
  ```
  EXAMPLE ONY, Check README.md for details
* If not, just make sure your changes don‚Äôt break anything.

---

## Commit your changes

A **commit** is like saving a snapshot of your progress.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in README"
```

---

### `git add .`

* The `.` means **current directory and everything inside it**.
* This will **stage all changes** (new files, modified files, deleted files) inside your project.
* Useful when you want to commit *everything* you‚Äôve changed.

Be careful ‚Äî it might also stage files you don‚Äôt want (like temporary logs or configs), so make sure your `.gitignore` is set properly.

---

### `git add <file_name>`

* This stages **only that one file**.
* You have control ‚Äî nothing else will be staged.
* Useful when you want to commit small, specific changes (best practice for clean commit history).

Example:

```bash
git add index.py
git add src/app.py
```

---

Rule of thumb:

* Use `git add <file>` for **focused commits**.
* Use `git add .` when you‚Äôre confident all changes are ready to commit.

---

Write clear commit messages:

* Bad: `fix stuff`
* Good: `Fix typo in installation guide`

---

## Push and Open a Pull Request

1. Push your branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

2. Go to GitHub ‚Üí You‚Äôll see a button to **Open Pull Request (PR)**.

3. In the PR description:

   * Explain what you changed
   * Mention why it‚Äôs useful

---

## Code Review

* Project maintainers will review your PR.
* They may ask for changes ‚Üí don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs normal!
* After approval, your changes get merged üéâ

---

## Tips for Beginners

* Don‚Äôt be afraid of making mistakes ‚Äî that‚Äôs how you learn.
* Even fixing a typo is a great contribution.
* Ask questions if you‚Äôre stuck, we‚Äôre here to help.
